NAME
    Perinci::Sub::Wrapper::property::retry - Specify automatic retry

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     # in function metadata
     retry => 3,

     # more detailed
     retry => {n=>3, delay=>10, success_statuses=>/^(2..|3..)$/},

DESCRIPTION
    This property specifies retry behavior.

    Values: a hash containing these keys 'n' (int, number of retries,
    default is 0 which means no retry), 'delay' (int, number of seconds to
    wait before each retry, default is 0 which means no wait between
    retries), and 'success_statuses' (regex, which status is considered
    success, default is "^(2..|304)$"). Or it can also be an integer
    (specifying just 'n').

    If function does not return enveloped result (result_naked=0), which
    means there is no status returned, a function is assumed to fail only
    when it dies.

    This property's wrapper implementation currently uses a simple loop
    around the eval block.
